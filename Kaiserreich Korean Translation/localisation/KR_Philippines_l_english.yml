phil.0.t:0 "독립을 향한 길"
phil.0.d:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. In 1934, The Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."
phil.0.a:0 "Viva la Filipinas!"

phil.1.t:0 "마닐라에서의 생디칼리스트 봉기"
phil.1.d:0 "As we have peacefully achieved independence from the United States due to their chaotic Civil War, our young Commonwealth is already facing the dangers of syndicalism. Inspired by both the Combined Syndicates' uprising in America and by the Bharatiya Commune in India, a group of disgruntled army officers have ordered their units to march towards our capital, where they have joined forces with bands of peasants and industrial workers. They are planning to establish a Syndicalist state on our archipelago!"
phil.1.a:0 "Rebels seize the capital and prepare to establish a Syndicalist regime."
phil.1.b:0 "Order our forces to resist the uprising."

phil.2.t:0 "The Army Counter-Coup"
phil.2.d:0 "Despite the Syndicalist-sympathising units seizing most of downtown Manilla, most of the armed forces are still currently siding with the legal government. Will they join the revolutionaries?"

phil.2.b:0 "Loyal units storm the capital and evict the Syndicalists."

phil.4.t:0 "The Revolution is Defeated"
phil.4.d:0 "As the armed forces declared their support for our government, the rebellious units quickly lost support. After one of our generals drove an armoured column towards downtown Manilla, the syndicalists officially surrendered, ending the threat of a Syndicalist coup in our country. With the army occupying key points in the city, however, a new menace looms over the horizon, there are talks that the military may attempt to take the chance to seize power for themselves and establish a dictatorship of their own."
phil.4.a:0 "The army restores the legal government to power."

Our politicians have come up with several plans, which involve increasing our industrial capacity, moving our economy with an expansion of our armed forces, or developing our mining and forestry sectors. Which shall we choose?"

phil.7.a:0 "Germany is the world's mightiest nation, they shall help us on this."
phil.7.b:0 "Japan is our natural partner."
phil.7.c:0 "Seek financing from Australasia and the Entente."
phil.7.e:0 "The Commune of France shall help us."

phil.14.t:0 "German Naval Base in the Philippines?"

Some politicians fear the growing German influence on our country, but a good part of our cabinet believe that we could use their help on a new round of economic expansion plans."

phil.19.t:0 "Alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.19.d:0 "A few years ago, when Thailand entered a military alliance with Japan, we managed to counter this move by convincing Burma to join our own military bloc. Due to our growing influence on the Philippines, some within our cabinet believe that we should invite their government to the Reichspakt as well."
phil.19.a:0 "Not interested."
phil.19.b:0 "Make the proposal."

phil.20.t:0 "Join the German Bloc?"

phil.57.t:0 "New Naval Base in the Philippines"
phil.57.d:0 "As previously agreed with the Republic of the Philippines, the new base of the Australasian Navy in the island of Luzon has been inaugurated today. This new facility will help us conducting new operations in the Pacific and put the Japanese and the Germans in check!"

phil.59.t:0 "An Alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.59.d:0 "Currently, two major power blocs are present in Southeast Asia- the German Empire has established their presence through their colonies and through an alliance with Burma, while the Japanese cemented an alliance with Thailand. This has left our allies, Australasia, vulnerable to any attack. We should reinforce our position in the region by inviting the Philippines to the Entente."
phil.59.a:0 "Not interested."
phil.59.b:0 "Make the proposal."

phil.60.t:0 "Join the Entente?"
phil.60.d:0 "Two major power blocs are present in Southeast Asia- Germany has established their presence through their colonies and an alliance with Burma, while Japan cemented an alliance with Thailand. This made Australasia vulnerable to any attack. Now, Canada and the Confederation have invited us to their alliance. Should we accept? Even though we will certainly profit through trade deals with Canada and her sphere of influence, we may be dragged into an unwanted conflict against Japan or Germany."
phil.60.a:0 "This is too dangerous, we are not interested."
phil.60.b:0 "Accept their proposal."

phil.63.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us with a plan to prevent a minor economic crisis in their country - they plan to expand their armed forces, thus increasing their industrial output, and wish the Commune helps them on this task. This could prove useful - not only we'd prevent an economic crisis in that country, but we will gain a new friend, countering Japanese and German influence on the Asia-Pacific area and a gaining a springboard for the spread of the Revolution in the region."
phil.63.a:0 "We will help them expanding and modernising of their army."
phil.63.b:0 "We have no interest in Asia yet."

phil.64.t:0 "Philippines Request Communard Support"
phil.64.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us, as they are looking for our help with expanding their industrial output, aiming on becoming a major economic power on Southeast Asia.

phil.66.t:0 "New Divisions Raised with Communard Aid"
phil.66.d:0 "After nearly one year, new infantry units are ready to be deployed. These divisions were developed in our own country, with help from industrial specialists from the Commune of France.

phil.69.t:0 "Syndicalism in East Asia"
phil.69.d:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have thought about considering that nation as our springboard for the spread of Syndicalism in East Asia. Therefore, we should invite them to join our military alliance, the Internationale. Some ministers see East Asia as too much a distant objective for us, but instead propose that we pass the responsibility on to the Bharatiya Commune."
phil.69.a:0 "Invite them to join the Internationale."
phil.69.b:0 "Promote an alliance between the Bharatiya Commune and the Philippines."
phil.69.c:0 "Syndicalism in Asia is only a distant goal."

phil.70.t:0 "Communard Alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.70.d:0 "The Commune of France, the cradle of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been undertaking economic aid programmes with a new socialist republic in Asia, the Philippines. If that young republic ever falls into a war against the bourgeoisie powers, however, France is too far to do much help. Therefore, they have asked us to enter talks with the Philippines and attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."
phil.70.a:0 "Not interested, sorry."
phil.70.b:0 "Make the proposal."

phil.701.t:0 "Eastern Syndicalist Union and the Philippines?"
phil.701.d:0 "The Commune of France, cradle of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been observing with great interest the socialist reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. Even if we are a bastion of socialism in Asia, France is too far away, and wouldn't be able to do much in case we get involved in a war. Therefore, they have convinced the Bharatiya Commune to enter talks with us and attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."

phil.74.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us with a plan to prevent a minor economic crisis in their country - they are planning to expand their armed forces, thus increasing their industrial output and creating jobs for their people.

phil.80.t:0 "Re-establishing Old Ties"
phil.80.d:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have considered reestablishing our protection over that country. Even if reestablishing the old U.S-controlled Commonwealth would be nearly impossible, we should at least try to get them into an alliance with us."

phil.80.b:0 "We no longer have interests in East Asia."

phil.81.t:0 "An American Proposal"
phil.81.d:0 "Even if our two countries no longer have any political ties as they had before the American Civil War, the United States has been observing with great interest the reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines.

phil.84.t:0 "The Philippines Question?"
